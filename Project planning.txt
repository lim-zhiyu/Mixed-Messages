<name>

Health: drink more water, get better sleep, eat healthier food, exercise more

Gacha: go for it, now is not the time, don't spend all resources in one go, wait a bit longer

Additional comment (depends on Overall luck):
    bad or very bad: think twice before you do something important, don't do something reckless

    good or very good: good day to try out something new
