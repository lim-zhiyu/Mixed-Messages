#Mixed Messages - Fortune Generator

A very simple JavaScript program written for Codecademy's Mixed Messages portfolio project. The program will display a randomised output when it runs. The content of the output is only for fun and should not affect the user's luck or fortune in any way. The idea for the program originated from "omikuji" in Japanese shrines.

##Technologies
JavaScript ES6

##How to run
Download and install Node.js on your computer, then navigate to the directory where "main.js" is located using a CLI like Command Prompt. Finally, run the command "node main.js".
